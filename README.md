# Minor_Projects
Small-scale projects and experiments in Python, Streamlit, SQL, and Data Analysis — exploring data processing, visualization, and app development.

🧩 Minor Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of mini and experimental projects that I built while learning and exploring different areas of Machine Learning, NLP, Computer Vision, and Streamlit development.
Each project focuses on a specific concept or application — from data preprocessing to interactive web apps.

🚀 Projects Included

🧠 NLP & Text Processing
- Text Preprocessor (NLP) – Performs text cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization for NLP tasks.
- Text to Speech & Speech to Text App – Converts text input to voice output and recognizes spoken input using speech recognition and gTTS.

💰 Prediction & Forecasting
- Loan Approval Prediction – Machine Learning model predicting loan eligibility based on applicant details.
- Gold Price Prediction – Regression-based model predicting gold prices using historical data.

🖼️ Computer Vision & Image Processing
- Image Preprocessing App (OpenCV + MediaPipe + CVZone) – Advanced image editor featuring background blur/removal, edge detection, filters, and effects.

📊 Web Apps & Data Visualization
- SQL CRUD Web App (Streamlit) – A web-based interface for Create, Read, Update, Delete operations on SQL databases.
- Data Analysis App (Streamlit) – Upload datasets, visualize statistics, and perform exploratory data analysis interactively.

🧰 Tech Stack
- Languages: Python
- Libraries & Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, OpenCV, MediaPipe, CVZone, Streamlit, gTTS, SpeechRecognition, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SQLite/MySQL

- Concepts: Data Preprocessing, Machine Learning, NLP, Computer Vision, Web App Development
